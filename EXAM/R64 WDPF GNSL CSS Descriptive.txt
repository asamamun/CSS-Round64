 1. What is the Box Model in CSS?
   The CSS box model consists of four parts: content, padding, border, and margin. These properties define the space around an element and how it interacts with other elements.
 2. What is the difference between `margin` and `padding`?
     - Margin is the space outside an element's border, creating space between elements.
     - Padding is the space inside an element's border, between the content and the border.
 3. What is the difference between `display: block`, `display: inline`, and `display: inline-block`?
     - Block: Takes the full width of its container and starts on a new line (e.g., `<div>`).
     - Inline: Takes only as much width as its content and does not start on a new line (e.g., `<span>`).
     - Inline-block: Combines features of both; it takes only as much width as its content but allows setting width, height, padding, and margin.
 4. What is the purpose of the `z-index` property?
   The `z-index` property controls the stacking order of elements. A higher `z-index` value brings an element to the front, while a lower value sends it to the back. It only works on elements with a `position` value other than `static` (e.g., `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`).
 5. What is the difference between `position: absolute` and `position: relative`?
     - Relative: Positions the element relative to its normal position in the document flow.
     - Absolute: Positions the element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the viewport if no ancestor is positioned).
 6. What is the difference between `em` and `rem` units?
     - em: Relative to the font size of the parent element.
     - rem: Relative to the font size of the root (`<html>`) element.
 7. What is the purpose of the `float` property?
   The `float` property is used to position an element to the left or right of its container, allowing text or other elements to wrap around it. Common values are `left`, `right`, and `none`.
 8. How do you apply styles to multiple elements at once?
   Use a comma-separated list of selectors. Example:
     h1, h2, h3 {    color: blue;     }
 9. What is the difference between `visibility: hidden` and `display: none`?
     - `visibility: hidden`: Hides the element but still occupies space in the layout.
     - `display: none`: Completely removes the element from the layout, and no space is reserved for it.
 10. What is the `cascade` in CSS?
   - The cascade is the process by which CSS determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple rules match. It considers:
     - Specificity: More specific selectors override less specific ones.
     - Importance: `!important` declarations override normal rules.
