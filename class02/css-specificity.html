    <h1>What Happens When Style Rules Conflict? CSS specificity</h1>
    <pre>
    When multiple CSS rules conflict (i.e., when two or more rules target the same element and define the same property but with different values), the browser uses **CSS specificity** to determine which rule takes precedence. Specificity is a weight or score that determines which style rule is applied to an element.

---

### How Specificity Works
Specificity is calculated based on the components of a CSS selector. The more specific a selector is, the higher its priority. Specificity is broken down into four levels:

1. **Inline Styles**:
   - Inline styles (styles written directly in the `style` attribute of an HTML element) have the highest specificity.
   - Example: `<p style="color: red;">Hello</p>`

2. **ID Selectors**:
   - Selectors that include an ID (`#`) have higher specificity than class or element selectors.
   - Example: `#header { color: blue; }`

3. **Class, Attribute, and Pseudo-Class Selectors**:
   - Class selectors (`.`), attribute selectors (`[type="text"]`), and pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:nth-child()`) have medium specificity.
   - Example: `.my-class { color: green; }`

4. **Element and Pseudo-Element Selectors**:
   - Element selectors (`p`, `div`, `h1`) and pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) have the lowest specificity.
   - Example: `p { color: black; }`

---

### Specificity Calculation
Specificity is represented as a tuple of four values: `(a, b, c, d)`, where:
- `a`: Number of inline styles.
- `b`: Number of ID selectors.
- `c`: Number of class, attribute, and pseudo-class selectors.
- `d`: Number of element and pseudo-element selectors.

The specificity is compared from left to right. For example:
- `(1, 0, 0, 0)` (inline style) beats `(0, 2, 0, 0)` (two IDs).
- `(0, 1, 0, 0)` (one ID) beats `(0, 0, 10, 0)` (ten classes).

---

### Examples of Specificity

#### Example 1:
```css
/* Specificity: (0, 0, 1, 0) */
.my-class {
    color: blue;
}

/* Specificity: (0, 0, 0, 1) */
p {
    color: red;
}
```
In this case, `.my-class` has higher specificity than `p`, so the text color will be **blue**.

---

#### Example 2:
```css
/* Specificity: (0, 1, 0, 0) */
#header {
    color: green;
}

/* Specificity: (0, 0, 1, 0) */
.header {
    color: orange;
}
```
Here, `#header` has higher specificity than `.header`, so the text color will be **green**.

---

#### Example 3:
```css
/* Specificity: (0, 0, 1, 1) */
div p.my-class {
    color: purple;
}

/* Specificity: (0, 0, 2, 0) */
.my-class.another-class {
    color: yellow;
}
```
In this case, `.my-class.another-class` has higher specificity than `div p.my-class`, so the text color will be **yellow**.

---

#### Example 4:
```html
<p style="color: pink;">Hello</p>
```
```css
/* Specificity: (0, 0, 1, 0) */
p {
    color: red;
}
```
Here, the inline style (`style="color: pink;"`) has the highest specificity, so the text color will be **pink**.

---

### Important Notes:
1. **`!important` Rule**:
   - The `!important` declaration overrides all other specificity rules.
   - Example:
     ```css
     p {
         color: red !important;
     }
     ```
     This will make the text color **red**, regardless of other conflicting rules.

2. **Equal Specificity**:
   - If two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears **last** in the CSS file takes precedence.

3. **Universal Selector (`*`)**:
   - The universal selector has no specificity (`(0, 0, 0, 0)`).

4. **Combined Selectors**:
   - When combining selectors, their specificity values are added together.
   - Example: `div#header .my-class` has a specificity of `(0, 1, 1, 1)`.

### Specificity Cheat Sheet
| Selector Type               | Example                | Specificity Value |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Inline Style                | `style="color: red;"`  | `(1, 0, 0, 0)`    |
| ID Selector                 | `#header`              | `(0, 1, 0, 0)`    |
| Class Selector              | `.my-class`            | `(0, 0, 1, 0)`    |
| Attribute Selector          | `[type="text"]`        | `(0, 0, 1, 0)`    |
| Pseudo-Class                | `:hover`               | `(0, 0, 1, 0)`    |
| Element Selector            | `p`                    | `(0, 0, 0, 1)`    |
| Pseudo-Element              | `::before`             | `(0, 0, 0, 1)`    |
| Universal Selector          | `*`                    | `(0, 0, 0, 0)`    |

### Practical Tips:
- Avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary, as it can make debugging difficult.
- Use IDs sparingly, as they increase specificity significantly.
- Organize your CSS to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
- Use tools like browser developer tools to inspect and debug specificity issues.
